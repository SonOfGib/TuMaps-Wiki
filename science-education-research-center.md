>SERC contains leading-edge labs and classrooms to attract talented scholars and to provide students with abundant opportunities for exploration and investigation. To fully support moving scientific breakthroughs from the lab to the real world, SERC will contain the latest communications, safety, HVAC and other technologies.

The Science Education and Research Center, or SERC for short, is one of the newest buildings on Temple's campus. It houses several large lecture rooms on the first floor, physics and computer labs on the second floor, and research labs and offices on the third and fourth floors, and CST classes and labs are often located here.

The SERC is connected to the neighboring Gladfelther Hall, and there is a passage way between the two buildings on their first floors. There is also a small food stand on the first floor of the SERC, near the passage way between SERC and Gladfelter.
